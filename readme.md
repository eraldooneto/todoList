# Todo app ✅❌📃

This is a server-side application that I've developed using NodeJs, Express and yarn. Basically, you can create users and attribute todos for them. There are some 
features that I really enjoyed to develop: 

- create a new todo 
- set a todo status done 
- update a todo deadline and description
- delete a todo
- Check if a user or todo exists before every action 

I used a couple middlewares to manage the requirements and responses among the features.

Then, I learned how to work with tests. A simple, but an elegant challenge.
